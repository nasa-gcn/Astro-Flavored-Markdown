# Hello, world

This paragraph refers to GCN Circular 123 and GCN 456

You can refer to a Circular by its URL: https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/26640

A legacy URL works too: https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn3/26640.gcn3

And even really weird legacy URLs work: https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn/gcn/gcn3/33567.gcn3

GCN Circ. 789 and GCN Circs. 3 and 4

And this one refers to GCNs 1, 23a, 45.5 and 42
